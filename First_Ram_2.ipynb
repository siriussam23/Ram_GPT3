      "Business Goals\n",
      "\n",
      "To enhance G2G interaction by building a cognitive Virtual Assistant that can act on behalf of ADDA support teams and SMEs. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Allowing other government departments to easily get the common questions end users ask, and in a format that they can easily understand. For the less common questions the system will attempt to find the best answer, or inform ADDA or the end user if it is needed to be escalated. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ability to find the correct content will be based on the content ingested into the software to train and respond. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "User Scenario (Current State)\n",
      "\n",
      "There are approx. 30 domains that cover all policies. While it is possible for government employees to learn these, government departments frequently have new employees who have to learn the same content. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The following is a diagram of the current user scenario workflow. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "Government employee contacts ADDA by phone or chat. This can be through the designated support team or directly. Often once a government employee finds someone who is very helpful, they will tend to ring them directly to short circuit the process. \n",
      "\n",
      "ADDA employee understands the issue the customer wants to resolve. They may answer directly. Alternatively, they may have to research the issue and follow up later. Or, redirect the call to someone with specialised domain knowledge. \n",
      "\n",
      "ADDA Employee records the interaction and outcome with the customer. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is common for the same departments to ask the same questions due to employee, or process changes (the latter rarely happens).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently the workload is as follows. \n",
      "\n",
      "Average 6 questions a day in the Data Management Domain. This can be extrapolated across the different regulatory domains handled by ADDA\n",
      "\n",
      "Common issues take 2-3 minutes by phone, 3-4 minutes by chat. \n",
      "\n",
      "Approx. 30% of issues are uncommon and require further research/time to resolve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Follow up on questions are common. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For the government employee trying to solve their issue they suffer with the following pain points. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hard to find the right person with the narrow expertise for the related question. \n",
      "\n",
      "Interpretations of the standards can happen confusing the real solution (XY Problem). \n",
      "\n",
      "Complexity of standards. Can lead to an answer requiring multiple document sources referenced, many of which the end user may not even be aware of. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "User Scenario (Desired State)\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "Government employee talks to Virtual Assistant about their issue. \n",
      "\n",
      "Optionally the Virtual Assistant may ask to see their current documents to understand the context of the question, and where they are. It will also help in filling out the document. \n",
      "\n",
      "Virtual Assistant will give answer and possible other topics to assist with areas they may not know. \n",
      "\n",
      "Where the Virtual Assistant cannot understand the employee, it will attempt to clarify or drill down on their request to better answer it. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the Virtual Assistant determines it is not a common issue, it will attempt to find the answer within the corpus of data it has been trained on. If it finds something that matches then it will display the information, with a link to the full content. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the Virtual Assistant feels it cannot answer after a number of times, or detects stress in the employee, it will attempt to either contact an ADDA employee to follow up, or recommend where they can get help. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Virtual Assistant will keep track of the full conversation, as well as creating a summary of questions asked, mood of employee and any other key points that may assist an ADDA employee at a later point. \n",
      "\n",
      "The end user can also ask about the status of any pending workflows. Optionally the Virtual Assistant can be asked to be proactive and follow up with the end user without prompting (through different channels). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Virtual Assistant framework would be designed to be rolled out to other government departments to assist them in dealing with customer issues. This would be a multi-tenancy framework so a single Virtual Assistant can be used to query on a number of different G2G services. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It will speak in an informal and friendly tone. Tone will change where a serious subject is to be discussed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chit-chat topics will be handled as follows. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "This document describes more specifically the data catalog implementation guidelines, the processes that enable data cataloguing and the roles and responsibilities that enable its development and maintenance. \n",
      "\n",
      "The data catalog shall serve as a repository to collect information about an ADGE’s data in a single location where this information can be accessed and maintained more conveniently. Furthermore, though some data may be relatively well understood, it is unlikely that even this data is described as comprehensively as it should be. \n",
      "\n",

It defines the business terms and definitions so that employees and relevant stakeholders can easily collaborate, understand the semantics behind data and how it is being used, including usage of business and data definitions, taxonomies, critical data attributes, KPIs, metrics, etc. This vocabulary furnishes clear meaning and business context and is linked to the underlying metadata to provide an association between terms and objects.

Maintenance can either be initiated by a request through the feedback channels of the platform, or by the ADGE that owns the dataset through a maintenance plan, or by any other governement stakholder through other government communication channels. The process could be triggered immediately in an ad-hoc manner based on the urgency of the request or if the open dataset fails to meet its quality level or there is a concerns regarding security or privacy, however for non-urgent requests the process would be triggered on a periodical basis with a frequency defined as part of the open data maintenance plan developed by each ADGE.\n",

      "This chapter identifies the document, describes the contents of the document, and states its purpose. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Description\n",
      "\n",
      "The statement of work document communicates a simple, clear and understandable overview of the target IT system. This solution overview is guided by the business objectives and business requirements leading to enabling IT architecture. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Business Goals\n",
      "\n",
      "To enhance G2G interaction by building a cognitive Virtual Assistant that can act on behalf of ADDA support teams and SMEs. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Allowing other government departments to easily get the common questions end users ask, and in a format that they can easily understand. For the less common questions the system will attempt to find the best answer, or inform ADDA or the end user if it is needed to be escalated. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ability to find the correct content will be based on the content ingested into the software to train and respond. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "User Scenario (Current State)\n",
      "\n",
      "There are approx. 30 domains that cover all policies. While it is possible for government employees to learn these, government departments frequently have new employees who have to learn the same content. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The following is a diagram of the current user scenario workflow. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "Government employee contacts ADDA by phone or chat. This can be through the designated support team or directly. Often once a government employee finds someone who is very helpful, they will tend to ring them directly to short circuit the process. \n",
      "\n",
      "ADDA employee understands the issue the customer wants to resolve. They may answer directly. Alternatively, they may have to research the issue and follow up later. Or, redirect the call to someone with specialised domain knowledge. \n",
      "\n",
      "ADDA Employee records the interaction and outcome with the customer. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is common for the same departments to ask the same questions due to employee, or process changes (the latter rarely happens).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently the workload is as follows. \n",
      "\n",
      "Average 6 questions a day in the Data Management Domain. This can be extrapolated across the different regulatory domains handled by ADDA\n",
      "\n",
      "Common issues take 2-3 minutes by phone, 3-4 minutes by chat. \n",
      "\n",
      "Approx. 30% of issues are uncommon and require further research/time to resolve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Follow up on questions are common. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For the government employee trying to solve their issue they suffer with the following pain points. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hard to find the right person with the narrow expertise for the related question. \n",
      "\n",
      "Interpretations of the standards can happen confusing the real solution (XY Problem). \n",
      "\n",
      "Complexity of standards. Can lead to an answer requiring multiple document sources referenced, many of which the end user may not even be aware of. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "User Scenario (Desired State)\n",
      "\n",
      "The following a diagram of the possible future state. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "Government employee talks to Virtual Assistant about their issue. \n",
      "\n",
      "Optionally the Virtual Assistant may ask to see their current documents to understand the context of the question, and where they are. It will also help in filling out the document. \n",
      "\n",
      "Virtual Assistant will give answer and possible other topics to assist with areas they may not know. \n",
      "\n",
      "Where the Virtual Assistant cannot understand the employee, it will attempt to clarify or drill down on their request to better answer it. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the Virtual Assistant determines it is not a common issue, it will attempt to find the answer within the corpus of data it has been trained on. If it finds something that matches then it will display the information, with a link to the full content. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the Virtual Assistant feels it cannot answer after a number of times, or detects stress in the employee, it will attempt to either contact an ADDA employee to follow up, or recommend where they can get help. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Virtual Assistant will keep track of the full conversation, as well as creating a summary of questions asked, mood of employee and any other key points that may assist an ADDA employee at a later point. \n",
      "\n",
      "The end user can also ask about the status of any pending workflows. Optionally the Virtual Assistant can be asked to be proactive and follow up with the end user without prompting (through different channels). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Virtual Assistant framework would be designed to be rolled out to other government departments to assist them in dealing with customer issues. This would be a multi-tenancy framework so a single Virtual Assistant can be used to query on a number of different G2G services. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It will speak in an informal and friendly tone. Tone will change where a serious subject is to be discussed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chit-chat topics will be handled as follows. \n",
      "\n",
      "Only the topic will be acknowledged, not the answer. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first response will respond in a friendly way. \n",
      "\n",
      "The second response if on the same topic will be cooler. It will acknowledge the topic, but suggest to go back on topic. \n",
      "\n",
      "The third response will only ask to go back on topic. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "This document describes more specifically the data catalog implementation guidelines, the processes that enable data cataloguing and the roles and responsibilities that enable its development and maintenance. \n",
      "\n",
      "The data catalog shall serve as a repository to collect information about an ADGE’s data in a single location where this information can be accessed and maintained more conveniently. Furthermore, though some data may be relatively well understood, it is unlikely that even this data is described as comprehensively as it should be. \n",
      "\n",
      "The data catalog consists of three artifacts:\n",
      "\n",
      "Dataset Inventory: document that incorporates a full list of the ADGE’s data\n",

      "The business glossary and data dictionary are simply ways to describe data, using metadata (data about data). A data catalog is a repository of metadata that combines both the business glossary and data dictionary. Therefore, the Business Glossary and Data Dictionary process is an essential step in the process of creating or updating a data catalog because it describes how an ADGE can identify and populate metadata for the datasets identified in its dataset inventory. \n",
      "\n",
      "This process should be triggered when an ADGE develops its data catalog for the first time and then becomes a continuous process through which the business glossary, data dictionary and any relevant metadata need is modified or updated.\n",

A business glossary is a repository of metadata that adds semantic context to data. It enables an organization to build trust and create accountability through common business terminologies. It defines the business terms and definitions so that employees and relevant stakeholders can easily collaborate, understand the semantics behind data and how it is being used, including usage of business and data definitions, taxonomies, critical data attributes, KPIs, metrics, etc. This vocabulary furnishes clear meaning and business context and is linked to the underlying metadata to provide an association between terms and objects. Business metadata which constitutes a business glossary consists of the content and condition of data and includes non-technical names and definitions\n",

Another scenario is one in which the requested data does not exist within the Abu Dhabi Government or exists in a different form than the requesting ADGE’s requirements and needs. In this case, the possibility of creating a dataset or modifying existing data needs to be assessed by the ADGEs that could potentially provide this data. \n",

      "General\n",
      "1. What do mandatory, recommend  standards mean?\n",
      "‘Mandatory’ Control Specifications are expected to be complied with in full by the Entity, from the time that the given Control Standard is implemented. Due to constraints of finite time and resources, it is recognised that an Entity will not be able to achieve compliance with all ‘Mandatory’ components from the outset of its own programme for data management. The Entity’s Data Management Programme Plan should demonstrate the prioritisation for control implementation, mapped to the relevant Control Standards within this document. Suggested priorities have been proposed against each Control Standard within this document, but Entities are expected to apply management discretion, based upon their business priorities and identified areas of weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended Control Specifications are those that ADSIC assessment teams would typically expect to see in place. However, there is the understanding that circumstances specific and unique to the Entity may mean that the given Control Specification is either not applied at all, or not applied in full. However, such exemptions would need to be on the basis of defined criteria that can be justified by the Entity. (It should not be interpreted that ‘Recommended’ Control Specification elements are merely advisable to implement.) For any Control Specification not designated as ‘Mandatory’, there is a degree of discretion and judgement that needs to be applied by the Entity’s management. \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "2. Do I have to comply with recommended standards?\n",
      "Recommended standards are highly advisable but optional.  Complying with recommended standards will increase the level of your department maturity and thus increase the level of ADSSSA maturity. \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "3. How is ADSSSA going to enforce the standards across departments\n",
      "Several awareness campaigns will be conducted by the Data Management Team, including workshops, training and presentations.  A comprehensive auditing process will be conducted to ensure compliance.  Furthermore, periodical audits will be in place to ensure continued compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "4. How often is ADSSSA going to update the standards?\n",
      "ADSSSA will maintain and update the standards to ensure its accuracy and comprehensiveness according to the latest DM standards available world-wide.  \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "5.What do I do if I need clarifications on some of the listed standards?\n",

      "10 How is Data Management Standards developed ? Based on what? \n",
      "Abu Dhabi Government has developed a core set of standards for data management based on 6 principles: \n",
      "1- Data shall be owned: all information used to enable the Entity’s business must have a designated owner who is accountable for its proper custody. \n",
      "2. Data shall be described: all data must be appropriately described to allow its content – and its purpose within the organisation – to be properly understood. \n",
      "3. Data shall be of known good quality: all data must be of the appropriate quality for its use within the organisation. \n",
      "4. Data shall be accessible: all data must be accessible to those who have a legitimate reason to use it. Data must be securely protected against loss, damage or misuse. \n",
      "5. Data shall be used and shared: all data must be available to share easily with any legitimate party, and its use appropriately managed. \n",

      "Question\n",
      "Answer\n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "1. What do mandatory, recommend  standards mean?\n",
      "‘Mandatory’ Control Specifications are expected to be complied with in full by the Entity, from the time that the given Control Standard is implemented. Due to constraints of finite time and resources, it is recognised that an Entity will not be able to achieve compliance with all ‘Mandatory’ components from the outset of its own programme for data management. The Entity’s Data Management Programme Plan should demonstrate the prioritisation for control implementation, mapped to the relevant Control Standards within this document. Suggested priorities have been proposed against each Control Standard within this document, but Entities are expected to apply management discretion, based upon their business priorities and identified areas of weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended Control Specifications are those that ADSIC assessment teams would typically expect to see in place. However, there is the understanding that circumstances specific and unique to the Entity may mean that the given Control Specification is either not applied at all, or not applied in full. However, such exemptions would need to be on the basis of defined criteria that can be justified by the Entity. (It should not be interpreted that ‘Recommended’ Control Specification elements are merely advisable to implement.) For any Control Specification not designated as ‘Mandatory’, there is a degree of discretion and judgement that needs to be applied by the Entity’s management. \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "2. Do I have to comply with recommended standards?\n",
      "Recommended standards are highly advisable but optional.  Complying with recommended standards will increase the level of your department maturity and thus increase the level of ADSSSA maturity. \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "3. How is ADSSSA going to enforce the standards across departments\n",
      "Several awareness campaigns will be conducted by the Data Management Team, including workshops, training and presentations.  A comprehensive auditing process will be conducted to ensure compliance.  Furthermore, periodical audits will be in place to ensure continued compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "4. How often is ADSSSA going to update the standards?\n",
      "ADSSSA will maintain and update the standards to ensure its accuracy and comprehensiveness according to the latest DM standards available world-wide.  \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "5.What do I do if I need clarifications on some of the listed standards?\n",
      "ADSSSA has Internal Data Management Team that you can submit your concerns, clarifications and support requests about the Standards and the implementation of Data Management program. The team leader is Mr. Abdulla Al Marzouqi. \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "6.How do I submit my changes, modifications, or additional standards requests to ADSIC?\n",
      "ADSIC has a set of templates for that purpose and more.  Also, ADSIC has a correspondence management system to handle all incoming IT Architecture & Standards related requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "7. Will ADSIC provide Data Management related training?\n",
      "ADSSSA Data Management Team will conduct Several awareness sessions, including workshops, training and presentations. In addition, the team will be glad to schedule one-to-one meetings for more guidance and explanation. \n",
      "\n",

      "9. How can I contact ADSSSA Data Management? \n",
      "ADSSSA Data Management team can be contacted through: ADSSADM@adsic.abudhabi.ae \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "10 How is Data Management Standards developed ? Based on what? \n",
      "Abu Dhabi Government has developed a core set of standards for data management based on 6 principles: \n",
      "1- Data shall be owned: all information used to enable the Entity’s business must have a designated owner who is accountable for its proper custody. \n",
      "2. Data shall be described: all data must be appropriately described to allow its content – and its purpose within the organisation – to be properly understood. \n",
      "3. Data shall be of known good quality: all data must be of the appropriate quality for its use within the organisation. \n",
      "4. Data shall be accessible: all data must be accessible to those who have a legitimate reason to use it. Data must be securely protected against loss, damage or misuse. \n",
      "5. Data shall be used and shared: all data must be available to share easily with any legitimate party, and its use appropriately managed. \n",
      "6. Data management shall be implemented: appropriate management of all data must be implemented through initiatives designed to introduce or strengthen particular data management capabilities.\n",

      "Question\n",
      "Answer\n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "1. What do mandatory, recommend  standards mean?\n",
      "‘Mandatory’ Control Specifications are expected to be complied with in full by the Entity, from the time that the given Control Standard is implemented. Due to constraints of finite time and resources, it is recognised that an Entity will not be able to achieve compliance with all ‘Mandatory’ components from the outset of its own programme for data management. The Entity’s Data Management Programme Plan should demonstrate the prioritisation for control implementation, mapped to the relevant Control Standards within this document. Suggested priorities have been proposed against each Control Standard within this document, but Entities are expected to apply management discretion, based upon their business priorities and identified areas of weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended Control Specifications are those that ADSIC assessment teams would typically expect to see in place. However, there is the understanding that circumstances specific and unique to the Entity may mean that the given Control Specification is either not applied at all, or not applied in full. However, such exemptions would need to be on the basis of defined criteria that can be justified by the Entity. (It should not be interpreted that ‘Recommended’ Control Specification elements are merely advisable to implement.) For any Control Specification not designated as ‘Mandatory’, there is a degree of discretion and judgement that needs to be applied by the Entity’s management. \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "2. Do I have to comply with recommended standards?\n",
      "Recommended standards are highly advisable but optional.  Complying with recommended standards will increase the level of your department maturity and thus increase the level of ADSSSA maturity. \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "3. How is ADSSSA going to enforce the standards across departments\n",
      "Several awareness campaigns will be conducted by the Data Management Team, including workshops, training and presentations.  A comprehensive auditing process will be conducted to ensure compliance.  Furthermore, periodical audits will be in place to ensure continued compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "4. How often is ADSSSA going to update the standards?\n",
      "ADSSSA will maintain and update the standards to ensure its accuracy and comprehensiveness according to the latest DM standards available world-wide.  \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "5.What do I do if I need clarifications on some of the listed standards?\n",
      "ADSSSA has Internal Data Management Team that you can submit your concerns, clarifications and support requests about the Standards and the implementation of Data Management program. The team leader is Mr. Abdulla Al Marzouqi. \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "6.How do I submit my changes, modifications, or additional standards requests to ADSIC?\n",
      "ADSIC has a set of templates for that purpose and more.  Also, ADSIC has a correspondence management system to handle all incoming IT Architecture & Standards related requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "7. Will ADSIC provide Data Management related training?\n",
      "ADSSSA Data Management Team will conduct Several awareness sessions, including workshops, training and presentations. In addition, the team will be glad to schedule one-to-one meetings for more guidance and explanation. \n",
      "\n",

      "9. How can I contact ADSSSA Data Management? \n",
      "ADSSSA Data Management team can be contacted through: ADSSADM@adsic.abudhabi.ae \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "10 How is Data Management Standards developed ? Based on what? \n",
      "Abu Dhabi Government has developed a core set of standards for data management based on 6 principles: \n",
      "1- Data shall be owned: all information used to enable the Entity’s business must have a designated owner who is accountable for its proper custody. \n",
      "2. Data shall be described: all data must be appropriately described to allow its content – and its purpose within the organisation – to be properly understood. \n",
      "3. Data shall be of known good quality: all data must be of the appropriate quality for its use within the organisation. \n",
      "4. Data shall be accessible: all data must be accessible to those who have a legitimate reason to use it. Data must be securely protected against loss, damage or misuse. \n",
      "5. Data shall be used and shared: all data must be available to share easily with any legitimate party, and its use appropriately managed. \n",
      "6. Data management shall be implemented: appropriate management of all data must be implemented through initiatives designed to introduce or strengthen particular data management capabilities.\n",

      "Question\n",
      "Answer\n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "1. What do mandatory, recommend  standards mean?\n",
      "‘Mandatory’ Control Specifications are expected to be complied with in full by the Entity, from the time that the given Control Standard is implemented. Due to constraints of finite time and resources, it is recognised that an Entity will not be able to achieve compliance with all ‘Mandatory’ components from the outset of its own programme for data management. The Entity’s Data Management Programme Plan should demonstrate the prioritisation for control implementation, mapped to the relevant Control Standards within this document. Suggested priorities have been proposed against each Control Standard within this document, but Entities are expected to apply management discretion, based upon their business priorities and identified areas of weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended Control Specifications are those that ADSIC assessment teams would typically expect to see in place. However, there is the understanding that circumstances specific and unique to the Entity may mean that the given Control Specification is either not applied at all, or not applied in full. However, such exemptions would need to be on the basis of defined criteria that can be justified by the Entity. (It should not be interpreted that ‘Recommended’ Control Specification elements are merely advisable to implement.) For any Control Specification not designated as ‘Mandatory’, there is a degree of discretion and judgement that needs to be applied by the Entity’s management. \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "2. Do I have to comply with recommended standards?\n",
      "Recommended standards are highly advisable but optional.  Complying with recommended standards will increase the level of your department maturity and thus increase the level of ADSSSA maturity. \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "3. How is ADSSSA going to enforce the standards across departments\n",
      "Several awareness campaigns will be conducted by the Data Management Team, including workshops, training and presentations.  A comprehensive auditing process will be conducted to ensure compliance.  Furthermore, periodical audits will be in place to ensure continued compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "4. How often is ADSSSA going to update the standards?\n",
      "ADSSSA will maintain and update the standards to ensure its accuracy and comprehensiveness according to the latest DM standards available world-wide.  \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "5.What do I do if I need clarifications on some of the listed standards?\n",
      "ADSSSA has Internal Data Management Team that you can submit your concerns, clarifications and support requests about the Standards and the implementation of Data Management program. The team leader is Mr. Abdulla Al Marzouqi. \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "6.How do I submit my changes, modifications, or additional standards requests to ADSIC?\n",
      "ADSIC has a set of templates for that purpose and more.  Also, ADSIC has a correspondence management system to handle all incoming IT Architecture & Standards related requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "7. Will ADSIC provide Data Management related training?\n",
      "ADSSSA Data Management Team will conduct Several awareness sessions, including workshops, training and presentations. In addition, the team will be glad to schedule one-to-one meetings for more guidance and explanation. \n",

      "9. How can I contact ADSSSA Data Management? \n",
      "ADSSSA Data Management team can be contacted through: ADSSADM@adsic.abudhabi.ae \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "10 How is Data Management Standards developed ? Based on what? \n",
      "Abu Dhabi Government has developed a core set of standards for data management based on 6 principles: \n",
      "1- Data shall be owned: all information used to enable the Entity’s business must have a designated owner who is accountable for its proper custody. \n",
      "2. Data shall be described: all data must be appropriately described to allow its content – and its purpose within the organisation – to be properly understood. \n",
      "3. Data shall be of known good quality: all data must be of the appropriate quality for its use within the organisation. \n",
      "4. Data shall be accessible: all data must be accessible to those who have a legitimate reason to use it. Data must be securely protected against loss, damage or misuse. \n",
      "5. Data shall be used and shared: all data must be available to share easily with any legitimate party, and its use appropriately managed. \n",
      "6. Data management shall be implemented: appropriate management of all data must be implemented through initiatives designed to introduce or strengthen particular data management capabilities.\n",

      "Question\n",
      "Answer\n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "1. What do mandatory, recommend  standards mean?\n",
      "‘Mandatory’ Control Specifications are expected to be complied with in full by the Entity, from the time that the given Control Standard is implemented. Due to constraints of finite time and resources, it is recognised that an Entity will not be able to achieve compliance with all ‘Mandatory’ components from the outset of its own programme for data management. The Entity’s Data Management Programme Plan should demonstrate the prioritisation for control implementation, mapped to the relevant Control Standards within this document. Suggested priorities have been proposed against each Control Standard within this document, but Entities are expected to apply management discretion, based upon their business priorities and identified areas of weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended Control Specifications are those that ADSIC assessment teams would typically expect to see in place. However, there is the understanding that circumstances specific and unique to the Entity may mean that the given Control Specification is either not applied at all, or not applied in full. However, such exemptions would need to be on the basis of defined criteria that can be justified by the Entity. (It should not be interpreted that ‘Recommended’ Control Specification elements are merely advisable to implement.) For any Control Specification not designated as ‘Mandatory’, there is a degree of discretion and judgement that needs to be applied by the Entity’s management. \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "2. Do I have to comply with recommended standards?\n",
      "Recommended standards are highly advisable but optional.  Complying with recommended standards will increase the level of your department maturity and thus increase the level of ADSSSA maturity. \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "3. How is ADSSSA going to enforce the standards across departments\n",
      "Several awareness campaigns will be conducted by the Data Management Team, including workshops, training and presentations.  A comprehensive auditing process will be conducted to ensure compliance.  Furthermore, periodical audits will be in place to ensure continued compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "4. How often is ADSSSA going to update the standards?\n",
      "ADSSSA will maintain and update the standards to ensure its accuracy and comprehensiveness according to the latest DM standards available world-wide.  \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "5.What do I do if I need clarifications on some of the listed standards?\n",
      "ADSSSA has Internal Data Management Team that you can submit your concerns, clarifications and support requests about the Standards and the implementation of Data Management program. The team leader is Mr. Abdulla Al Marzouqi. \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "6.How do I submit my changes, modifications, or additional standards requests to ADSIC?\n",
      "ADSIC has a set of templates for that purpose and more.  Also, ADSIC has a correspondence management system to handle all incoming IT Architecture & Standards related requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "7. Will ADSIC provide Data Management related training?\n",
      "ADSSSA Data Management Team will conduct Several awareness sessions, including workshops, training and presentations. In addition, the team will be glad to schedule one-to-one meetings for more guidance and explanation. \n",

      "9. How can I contact ADSSSA Data Management? \n",
      "ADSSSA Data Management team can be contacted through: ADSSADM@adsic.abudhabi.ae \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "10 How is Data Management Standards developed ? Based on what? \n",
      "Abu Dhabi Government has developed a core set of standards for data management based on 6 principles: \n",
      "1- Data shall be owned: all information used to enable the Entity’s business must have a designated owner who is accountable for its proper custody. \n",
      "2. Data shall be described: all data must be appropriately described to allow its content – and its purpose within the organisation – to be properly understood. \n",
      "3. Data shall be of known good quality: all data must be of the appropriate quality for its use within the organisation. \n",

      "Question\n",
      "Answer\n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "1. What do mandatory, recommend  standards mean?\n",
      "‘Mandatory’ Control Specifications are expected to be complied with in full by the Entity, from the time that the given Control Standard is implemented. Due to constraints of finite time and resources, it is recognised that an Entity will not be able to achieve compliance with all ‘Mandatory’ components from the outset of its own programme for data management. The Entity’s Data Management Programme Plan should demonstrate the prioritisation for control implementation, mapped to the relevant Control Standards within this document. Suggested priorities have been proposed against each Control Standard within this document, but Entities are expected to apply management discretion, based upon their business priorities and identified areas of weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended Control Specifications are those that ADSIC assessment teams would typically expect to see in place. However, there is the understanding that circumstances specific and unique to the Entity may mean that the given Control Specification is either not applied at all, or not applied in full. However, such exemptions would need to be on the basis of defined criteria that can be justified by the Entity. (It should not be interpreted that ‘Recommended’ Control Specification elements are merely advisable to implement.) For any Control Specification not designated as ‘Mandatory’, there is a degree of discretion and judgement that needs to be applied by the Entity’s management. \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "2. Do I have to comply with recommended standards?\n",
      "Recommended standards are highly advisable but optional.  Complying with recommended standards will increase the level of your department maturity and thus increase the level of ADSSSA maturity. \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "3. How is ADSSSA going to enforce the standards across departments\n",
      "Several awareness campaigns will be conducted by the Data Management Team, including workshops, training and presentations.  A comprehensive auditing process will be conducted to ensure compliance.  Furthermore, periodical audits will be in place to ensure continued compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "4. How often is ADSSSA going to update the standards?\n",
      "ADSSSA will maintain and update the standards to ensure its accuracy and comprehensiveness according to the latest DM standards available world-wide.  \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "5.What do I do if I need clarifications on some of the listed standards?\n",
      "ADSSSA has Internal Data Management Team that you can submit your concerns, clarifications and support requests about the Standards and the implementation of Data Management program. The team leader is Mr. Abdulla Al Marzouqi. \n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "6.How do I submit my changes, modifications, or additional standards requests to ADSIC?\n",
      "ADSIC has a set of templates for that purpose and more.  Also, ADSIC has a correspondence management system to handle all incoming IT Architecture & Standards related requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "7. Will ADSIC provide Data Management related training?\n",

      "\n",
      "General\n",
      "10 How is Data Management Standards developed ? Based on what? \n",
      "Abu Dhabi Government has developed a core set of standards for data management based on 6 principles: \n",
      "1- Data shall be owned: all information used to enable the Entity’s business must have a designated owner who is accountable for its proper custody. \n",
      "2. Data shall be described: all data must be appropriately described to allow its content – and its purpose within the organisation – to be properly understood. \n",
